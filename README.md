# CRM Optimization with Reinforcement Learning  

## Overview  
**CRM Optimization with Reinforcement Learning** is a project that applies reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to optimize customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.  
The agent learns how to select actions (e.g., when to engage, follow up, or pause) that maximize long-term campaign performance, customer engagement, and retention.  

This project was originally called *SalesReinforcer* and has been refactored for clarity, reproducibility, and professional presentation.  

Note: The CRM datasets used in this project are **proprietary** and therefore not included in this repository.

## Goals  
- Model CRM decision-making as a **reinforcement learning environment**.  
- Train an RL agent to learn **optimal customer engagement strategies**.  
- Maximize long-term campaign rewards (e.g., conversions, retention, ROI).  

---

## Features  
- **Reinforcement Learning Models:** Implemented **Q-learning** and extended to deep RL methods.  
- **Reward Function Design:** Encodes customer responses and campaign effectiveness.  
- **Visualization:** Tracks agent learning curves, policy convergence, and reward growth.  
- **Reproducibility:** End-to-end workflow in Jupyter notebooks.

## Methodology  
1. **Problem Formulation** – Framed CRM decision-making as a reinforcement learning problem.  
2. **Environment Setup** – Modeled states, actions, and rewards reflecting CRM interactions.  
3. **Agent Training** –  
   - Implemented **Q-learning** as baseline.  
   - Explored **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** for scalability.  
4. **Evaluation** – Assessed agent performance by cumulative rewards and campaign outcomes.  
5. **Visualization** – Learning curves, reward convergence, and action-distribution plots.

## Results  
- Q-learning agents outperformed random baseline strategies.  
- Deep RL approaches achieved faster convergence and better policy stability.  
- Results highlight the potential of RL for improving CRM efficiency and campaign ROI.
